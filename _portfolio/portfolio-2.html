3D views of QSL calculated from the potential field. The image on the bottom boundary shows the AIA 1600 A emission at 03:34:40 UT. The red lines represent the skeleton structure of the null-point. The western and the eastern structures of the large-scale QSL that correspond to the loop-like and dome-like structures in AIA 94 Ã… are labeled S1 and S2, respectively.
