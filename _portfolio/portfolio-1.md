Observations and synthesized EUV images showing the loop structures. The left column (a–c) shows the AIA observations at three channels. The right column (d–f) shows the synthetic images at the same channels generated with L = 160 km and R = 0.3. All images use linear color scales with units of DN s^−1, and corresponding pairs use the same color scale. The numbers indicate the corresponding structures, including brightening loops (1), moss structures (2 and 3) and large loops (4), respectively.
