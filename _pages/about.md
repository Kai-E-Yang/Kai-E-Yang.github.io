I am a solar physics researcher. My research interests in
* The solar coronal heating puzzle, contrasted with measured inputs, e.g., the heating power expression based on observed quantities.
* Magnetic topology of the solar corona, e.g., the magnetic helicity calculation, searching for null point, separatrix, and separator, and computing the quasi-separatrix layer.
* MHD instabilities that trigger eruptions, e.g., the kink instability related to the twist number before and after eruption.
