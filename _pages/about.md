### About Me

I am a solar physics researcher with a broad interest in understanding the Sun's dynamic processes and their implications. My research spans several key areas:

- ###### Solar Coronal Heating Puzzle: Investigating the mechanisms behind coronal heating by analyzing heating power expressions derived from observed quantities and contrasting them with measured inputs.

- ###### Magnetic Topology and Reconstruction of the Solar Corona: Exploring the magnetic structure of the solar corona, including magnetic helicity calculations, identifying null points, separatrices, separators, and computing quasi-separatrix layers.

- ###### MHD Instabilities and Eruptions: Examining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, such as the kink instability, to understand eruption triggers and the role of twist numbers pre- and post-eruption.

- ###### Solar and Stellar Flares: Bridging the gap between models and observations to unravel the dynamics of solar and stellar flares.


Recently, I have developed a strong interest in leveraging machine learning techniques for solar data analysis. My focus includes:

- ###### Reconstructing the 3D solar photosphere from spectropolarimetric (SP) observations.

- ###### Deriving the 3D coronal magnetic field from SP observations.
